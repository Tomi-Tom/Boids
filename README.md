# Boids ðŸ¤–

## Overview

Boids is a C++ project that aims to simulate crowd behavior graphically. The goal is to create a simulation that mimics the flocking movement of a group of birds using simple algorithms. Boids (birds) are able to follow a collective motion without the need for a leader.
Usage

To run the simulation, you need to execute the following command in your terminal:

```
./boids [population-size]
```

 - population-size : the number of birds to simulate.

## Installation

To install and run the project, you need the following:

A computer with a compatible operating system (Windows, Mac OS, Linux)
The C++ compiler g++ installed on your machine
The SFML graphics libraries


## Installation steps:

 - Clone the Git repository:


```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Boids.git
```
 - Install SFML by following the instructions for your operating system. You can find the installation guide on the official SFML website.
